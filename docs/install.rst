Installation
============

OpenFOAM version compatibility
------------------------------

The libWMLES library supports the OpenFOAM fork developed by `OpenCFD <https://openfoam.com/>`_.
Curently, releases from OpenCFD from v1806 up to v2312 are supported.
There is desire to support the Foundation and foam-extend forks as well, but cannot due to lack of time.
Please open an issue if you would be willing to work on maintaining compatibility with these forks!

The best level of testing is done for latest available release from OpenCFD, for which the test harness is run.
This consists of unit and integration tests that aim to cover all the functionality of the library.
A single system test is also run, which is a simulation of channel flow on a coarse grid, using the Spalding-law wall
model and otherwise default parameters in the :code:`nut` dictionary.

The aim is to support all new OpenCFD, meaning that the amount of supported versions grows with
two per year.
This is likely to become unsustainable, leading to deprecation of support for the oldest versions.

Compilation
-----------

Clone the repository with git or download it as an archive by navigating Downloads in the menu on Bitbucket.
A prerequisite for installing is having Python installed, but no packages are needed and any modern Python version
should do.
To compile, run ``Allwmake``.
Consider using the ``-j`` flag with a number of processors, to speed up the process.
If you get compilation errors, please make sure your OpenFOAM environment is properly set up before opening a Bitbucket
issue.
In particular, take notice of the first couple of lines in the output for ``Allwmake``, which are of the following
form::

   Current OpenFOAM version is v1806.
   This is a clean install
   OpenFOAM-version: Major 1806 Minor 0 Patch 0 (-1 == x / 0) Fork: com

As you can see, they state which version of OpenFOAM the install script has picked up.
If it doesn't correspond to your expectations, there is almost surely something fishy with you setup.

When recompiling for a different version of OpenFOAM than what was previously used, you should frist run ``Ã€llwclean``.
If you make several compilation attempts and things don't work, it can be a good idea to delete ``Make/linux*`` and
``lnInclude`` to make sure you start from a clean slate.

Running tests
-------------

To run the tests, Google Test and Google Mock should first be installed, see https://github.com/google/googletest.
The environmental variable :code:`GTEST_DIR` should point to the root directory containing both Google Test and Google
Mock (i.e. the directory to which you've clone the `googletest` repo).
Don't forget to copy the compiled libraries to your :code:`FOAM_USER_LIBBIN`.

The unit tests are located in the :code:`tests` directory, are compiled with :code:`wmake` producing the file `testRunner`,
which could be executed to run the tests.
The integration tests are located in :code:`test/integrationTests`, are also compiled with `wmake`, and the produced
executable is called `testIntegration`.
